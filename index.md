				    <p align="justify">A lot has changed... Everything has changed!!! I am now using <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, a blog-aware static site generator and I am hosting the entire website on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a>, probably the most trusted host in the world for free. I am making use of the awesome power of Jekyll with superior templating. No databases, no server side scripting. This is simply blogging for developers. &quot;We like to blog the way we code&quot; was one fantastic remark I found about Jekyll's remarkable abilities and got me started immediately. I have opted for a simplistic look. Simple is beautiful.</p>
                    <p align="justify">Rest assured, one thing hasn't changed and will never change. My desire to bring you the best of technology from all over the web in one place. Be it automobiles, education, science, gadgets or just interesting news, you'll find it all here in one place.</p>
