This is my first ever Firefox addon. Doesn't do much at the moment. If you install it, you will find a button on the navigation bar. Clicking on it opens up my blog's home page in a new tab :). Looking to add more features in the coming days.

####Installation####

    $ cd ~
    $ wget https://github.com/varunbpatil/firefox_addon/raw/master/varun_blog.xpi

Goto Firefox -> Add-ons. Click the spanner icon on the top right beside the search box. Select "install add-on from file" and choose the file you downloaded with the above command from your home folder. There is no need to restart Firefox to start using this addon. Enjoy :)

The project page can be found at [https://github.com/varunbpatil/firefox_addon](https://github.com/varunbpatil/firefox_addon)
