       My name is Varun B Patil, and I am a recent B.E/B.Tech graduate in Computer Science and Engineering living in Mysore, Karnataka, India. My new passion and hobby is web designing and in the last couple of years have been experimenting with different web technologies. I also like to code and most importantly love to experiment with new technologies. I like to be aware of all the latest technology and gadgets and I wish to make others aware as well through my blog. I am also a huge automotive technology fan even though I am not from a mechanical background. I love anything on four wheels and I am a huge fan of <a href="http://www.topgear.com/uk/" target="_blank">Top Gear U.K</a>, <a href="http://www.channel5.com/shows/fifth-gear" target="_blank">Fifth Gear</a> and other car shows. I like to learn new and interesting things in life especially in the technological sphere.

       In my free time I take computer science classes online from <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank">Coursera</a> and in the future hope to learn subjects other than those related to computer science as well. I also like to compose short simple tunes on my guitar. I am a self taught amateur guitarist. I am a huge fan of open source software and love Ubuntu. I love listening to music and also have a strong craving for constantly tinkering android ICS on my Motorola Defy. That said, I am a massive fan of custom android rom's like <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/" target="_blank">Cyanogenmod</a> and <a href="http://en.miui.com/" target="_blank">MIUI</a>.

       <h3>Skills</h3><br />
       <p style="text-align: justify;">
       I am fairly good and programming in C, C++ and Java although my work currently involves C and C++ exclusively. In the last couple of years I have tried to learn various web development technologies like HTML, jQuery, JavaScript, CSS, PHP and I have become fairly good at using them. Very recently I learnt about git and how to use it to maintain my projects. It was during this git learning stage that I stumbled upon <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, markdown and <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/liquid" target="_blank">Liquid</a> as a way to build static websites and host them on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. This got me started immediately and this website is the culmination of that effort. I am good at creating high quality documents and presentations using Latex as a result of all the project works at college level.

       <h3>This website</h3><br />
       <p style="text-align: justify">
       This website is my latest effort at creating a static website using <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, markdown and <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/liquid" target="_blank">Liquid</a>. I learnt about these new technologies while trying to find out more about git and immediately got working on it. Through this website I wish to communicate my thoughts and feelings regarding the latest technologies, gadgets, news and also elicit constructive responses from my blog readers. I blog about latest technologies, gadgets, softwares, cars, car shows, free online courses, and just plain interesting news !!!. I also wish to share all of my projects with my readers and also encourage their responses for improvements.
